	<h2>Basic</h2>
	<h3>Append your name to the text between the title tags.</h3>
	<br>
	<h3>Describe the purpose of JavaScript, how might it relate to web mapping and visualization?</h3>
	<p>Purpose of JavaScript is to help us interact with the webpage which otherwise 
	would be static. It adds a behavior to respond to users actions. It can add animations and
        images and allows response to actions that a user takes within a webpage. It has
	the ability to manipulate data .It doesnâ€™t have to wait for a response from external server
	as it is done on the user end.  In web mapping and visualization it specifically allows
	us to interact with them. Rather than just a static map it will help us display or
	visualize some useful information related to the map. It can add 2D or 3D animations
	to the maps and visualization. D3 is an example of such a library that can be used in
	JavaScript to create useful data animations and transitions. It can also add data
	element to otherwise simple webpage. For example it can add let you see some data of
	certain area on a map simply by hovering over the map area.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Variables</h2>
	<h3>What is a variable? Provide two examples of using a variable.</h3>
	<p>Variables are like containers that store data values 
        For example we have a variable station and we want to give it some value, 
        Var station = 5
        Now anywhere the station is used it will use 5.
        Var x = 2
        Var y = 5
        Var z = x * y
        It will give var z a value of 10

        We can use string instead of numbers 
        Var name = taqi
        Here variable is name and its value is taqi.
        </p>
	<br>
	<h3>Write out how to assign the variable x equal to 10.</h3>
	<p>Var x = 10</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Operators</h2>
	<h3>Describe the differences between =, ==, and ===.</h3>
	<p>= is used to assign a certain value to a variable. e.g 
        X = 5 means x has a value 5 or is is equal to 5
        == is used to check if something is equal to other. It converts the value to same type to check if they are same. It only compares values.
        === is also used to check if one thing is equal to other but additionally it compares both value and type.
        </p>
	<br>
	<h3>What would be the result of "Hello " + 10? Why?</h3>
	<p>It would print 10 after Hello. Like
        Hello10
        It is called unary + operator This plus operator tries to convert anything that comes
	after it into a function expression. It produces sum of both numeric and string operands.
        </p>
	<br>
	<h2>Loops</h2>
	<h3>What is the purpose of a for loop? Describe in detail the advantages of using the for loop.</h3>
	<p>Your answer here</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Describe the while loop in JavaScript.</h3>
	<p>Your answer here</p>
	<br>
	<h2>If/Else Statements</h2>
	<h3>What are the three <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp" target="_blank">conditional statements</a>? Describe how each are used.</h3>
	<p>Your answer here</p>
	<br>
	<h3>What is the difference between using two if statements together compared to using an if statement then an else if statement or else statement?</h3>
	<p>Your answer here</p>
